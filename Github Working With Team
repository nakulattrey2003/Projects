# Working with team 

Git Clone (All the changes are done directly to the project)
    > Make a repository
    > Add collaborators
    > For someone to change on that project
        > open gitbash where you want to save your project
        > write git clone https://github.com/githubUsername/nameOfTheRepo.git  // this link you will get from clicking on code on you repo ![clone link](image.png)
        > then go to the file in editor (like vs code)
        > make the changes you want to do
        > then go to gitbash and write add . (this will place the changes to staging area)
        > then write git commit -m "Message you want to write inside these double inverted commas" // this made the changes in the local repository
        > write git push origin main (this will make changes in the main branch, but you need access of the owner for it)

Git Fork (The project is copied on your remote Repo and all the changes are done on your own Repo and not on the Main Original project)
    > Choose the Project online what you want to copy
    > Open it and click fork button ![fork](image-1.png) (you cannot click the button of your own repository)
    > Project will be there on your own Account
    > You want changes to be done on Original Project then make a pull request on github stating what you had changed ![pull request](image-2.png)
    > If the owner think the change is ok, then he will accept the pull request.
